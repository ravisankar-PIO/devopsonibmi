## Observer
Arcad Observer is an Analysis tool (like iA) which is a desktop application that provides,
- X References on field level
- Flow charts
- Documentation of the architecture (not system!) (Refer MK Docs)
  
It comes with RDi pre installed, which is trapping the users in a Walled Garden

## Skipper
Arcad Skipper,
Checkout from Arcard is nothing but Pull from Git.
Web hooks from GitHub will create corresponding libraries onto the IBMi.
(Possibility of a middleman with reverse proxy)

Push is done from Arcad as (SCM Export)

Automation takes over after that.
